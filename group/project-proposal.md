# Project Proposal
### HIST 5152 Group Project Assignment

## About this assignment

## Directions
1. Choose one person from your group to turn in this assignment (You will work collaboratively, but I do not need an individual submission for each member of the group.)

## The Project Proposal
### Part I: The problem + evidence: **To be completed by 4pm September 26, 2022**

_Each group will identify a "problem" - a research question that they will attempt to answer in their project by incorporating their "evidence" - their analyzed source material. They will also take time to consider the group's intended audience, and how that might impact the formulation and presentation of a supported argument._

1. **What is (are) your research question(s)?** _You may define broadly at this early stage._

2. **What types of evidence are available to you to address this question?** _Be as broad or specific as you need to at this early stage, e.g. "census records" or "1910 Census Report Vol. 5: Agriculture."_

3. **What is your audience?** _Who is this project intended for? Be as specific as possible. This may help you know what complexity of language to use, how to handle navigability, and if you’ll need to anticipate any access barriers._

### Part II: The method(s): **To be completed by 4pm October 3, 2022**

_Each group will consider which tools and methodologies may help them convey a supported argument using their problem and evidence to the intended audience. They will also inventory their assets and needs at this point._

1. **What tools (specific) or methodologies/approaches (broad) will you use to develop or communicate your argument?**

2. **What are your current assets?** _What do you already have? Are there areas of expertise, previous training, special skills, knowledge, or talents that your team has access to? Do you have examples of similar projects that you can consult, emulate, or reverse-engineer? Have you already done some preliminary planning, sketches, prototyping, or experimentation that can inform your process?_

3. **What are your current needs?** 
 - Data & source material: _What data will you use, and where will you get it? Are there (copyright/cost/accessibility) obstacles to obtaining it? Does it already exist, or will you need to create it? Will you need to change its form in any way?_
 - Tech & tools: _What tool(s) will you use? Will you need training or guidance to use it (them)? Can you use them on your computer, or will you need to acquire or use other equipment (for instance, a video recorder from the Charles Library)? Do you have a plan if you run into technical problems? Do you have a backup tool in mind, in case the one you wish to use doesn’t work out for any reason?_

### Part III: The outcome: **To be completed by 4pm October 10, 2022**

_Each group will analyze their problem and evidence with the identified methods in order to convey an argument, and they will define parameters and a loose timeline for the project outcome._
