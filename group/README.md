## Directions
1. Choose one person from your group as the "submitter," who will turn in the group's assignment(s) (You will work collaboratively, but I do not need an individual submission for each member of the group.)
2. Work collaboratively to follow the directions and answer the questions below for each item by its due date. **Note: If you are not familiar with the "push," "pull" and "merge" functions of GitHub (not part of this course), I recommend using another collaborative text editor that you are familiar with, to simplify the process of multiple people editing the document at the same time.**
 - The Team Charter is due XX
 - Part I of the Project Proposal is due XX
 - Part II of the Project Proposal is due XX
 - Part III of the Project Proposal is due XX
3. The submitter of the group will make the necessary changes to the assignment document, type "DONE" in the larger box at the bottom of the edited page when it is ready to submit, and commit the changes. **Don't forget to commit your changes!! GitHub will not autosave your work!!**
